            My Trip Story is a trvel diary for a user. When we go somewhere we have the memories stored as photographs only. I wanted something more than that. So I have come up with the concept of travel diaries but in web page format. So you can search for a city you have visited and it will give you a list of all famous tourist destinations in that city. You can see details of particular place, bookmark it, write your experience in there and it will be saved to your dashboard. You can browse through other people's profiles as well they can browse through yours!! So get ready to have some fun. You need tologin when you want to bookmark or like, searching and details are public. Enjoy! :)
