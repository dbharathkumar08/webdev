<h3>Experiment Description</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Uppercase Filter</b></li>
    <p>
        Angular provides a variety of filters. Here I have used one of them : uppercase. This filter convertes the bounded variables's value to uppercase. Here I am inputting text from user and converting them to uppercase.
    </p>
    <li><b>Inline Editing Using Angular</b></li>
    <p>
        In this experiment I have used inline editing property of angular. User can edit the html data using this property. I have added the options to save or discard the changes he made.
    </p>
    <li><b>HTML DOM</b></li>
    <p>
        In this experiment I have tried playing with various DOM elements provided by angular. I have used <i>hide,show,disable,click</i> etc for that. When user checks the disabled option, the button gets disabled. When user checks show/hide the button is shown/hidden respectively. When user clicks on last button, everytime the counter is increased and total number of clicks are displayed.

</ul>
