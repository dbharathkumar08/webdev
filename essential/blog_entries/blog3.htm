Here is the link to experiments:

<h3>Experiment Description</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Weather Updates</b></li>
    <p>
        In this experiment I have tried my hands on API services. Here I have used worldweatheronline API for displaying the weather of input place. The user enters the City or Country or Places name in the input box and as he clicks on the Go! button, the current weather conditions of that place are displayed. These details include: Temprateure in Celcius and Ferenhit, Feels like temprature, weather condition description, humidity, weather icon etc. I have also enabled keyboard controls like Enter,Tab for the ease of use.
    </p>
    <li><b>Intro to Angular</b></li>
    <p>
        This is a basic experiment which gives an intro to angular js functionality. It shows how data is updated dynamically without rendering the whole page again. It shows how the DOM changes due to Angular. Here the user has to type his/her name in the input box and that name will appear in the begining of the paragraph.
    </p>
     <li><b>Filtering using Angular JS</b></li>
        <p>
            In this experiment I have tried to implement filtering functionality with help of angular js. Here there is a dataset given. On that dataset, filtering is applied. When the user types the book's title or its price in the input field, the dataset elements are filtered and the result is shown by updating the DOM. So it is a single page application where the user gets all result on single page without reloading it.
        </p>
    <li><b>Add/Remove using Angular JS</b></li>
    <p>
        In this experiment I have tried adding and removing elements from DOM dynamically.
