<h3>Experiment Description</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>login</b></li>
    <p>
        In this experiment I have created different user profiles and provided the login facility. Using Angular,I have created the Service, View, Controller model. LoginService is the service which stores the user details and check it aginast the entered details. Then there is loginController which changes the view according to result returned by loginService.
    </p>
    <li><b>Profile</b></li>

After loggin in the user is able to view his profile which is different for each user.

    <li><b>Profile Edit</b></li>
    <p>
        In this experiment, user is able to login to his profile and edit the information. There is additional controller provided here: ProfileController. This controller fetches the user information and displays it after user logs in. User can change that info and on save it. The next time user logs in, new info is shown to him.
    </p>
    <li><b>Uploading Profile Pic</b></li>
    <p>
        In this experiment, user is able to login to his profile and edit the profile picture. I have added an extra feature of photo in user data. when there is no pic, it shows the default one. Otherwise when user has chosen some picture, it checks for the type of file and stores the image as binary data base 64. On save changes event, this data is passed to loginService which stores it in user profile photo.
    </p>
    <li><b>Course Page</b></li>
    <p>
        In this experiment, I have tried replicating the course application taught by sir in the class. Here 3 different profiles are maintained namely:admin, faculty and student. Admin maintains accounts, faculty teaches and authors courses and students register in different classes. So UserService and CourseService are maintained. UserService maintains user data and ligin logout functionality. CourseService maintains the courseinfo and course add remove and get functionalities.
    </p>
</ul>
