<h3>Experiment Description</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>CSS Animation</b></li>
    <p>
        I wanted to create some animation using CSS for so long. So I searched a lot on web and finilized on creting floating and popping bubbles.
        Without using javascript I have made this animation.
    </p>
    <li><b>Having fun with bootstrap</b></li>
    <p>
        In this experiment I have tried my hands on Bootstrap framework. Here I have created an educational portal fot HTML,CSS,JavaScript and given it various CSS effects through Bootstrap. I have made use of:<br /><br />
        1) nav nav-tabs for Navigation purpose<br />
        2) dropdown-toggle for creating dropdown menu<br />
        3) embed-responsive-item to include videos in webpage<br />
        4) panel classes for creating Collapsable items
    </p>
     <li><b>Carousel</b></li>
        <p>
            In this experiment I have tried creating an image scroller also known as Carousel using Bootstrap. This experiment sutomatically scrolls images at interval of 5 secs. user can also go to next image manually using the side buttons.
        </p>
    <li><b>Image Drag and Resize</b></li>
    <p>
        Here I have created the code to resize a given image. User can drag the image on screen anywhere as well he can resize the image by pulling it from corners. I have made use of javascript resizable() and draggable functions for that. I have included the jQuery and javascript files from Google CDN to make the experiment run.
    </p>
    <li><b>Responsive Form without using Bootstrap</b></li>
    <p>
        Here I have created a responsive form design with a fixed header by using simple CSS. The form elements like textbox, columns will adjuxt themselves when the size is reduced from Desktop to Tablet to Mobile device. Also I have created a resonsive menu which somewhat changes to dropdown menu when the size is reduced. Also the Image in the form changes its size according to the screen size
    </p>
</ul>
