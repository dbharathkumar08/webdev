<h3>Experiment Description</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Star Rating</b></li>
    <p>
        Here in this experiment, I have displayed the usage of star ratings. We are supposed to comment on some user portfolio or search object and maybe rate it too. So I have added this star rating for that. I am using a plugin <i>rateit</i> for it. It uses css and jQuery to display the visual effects.

    <li><b>Place Search Autocomplete</b></li>
    <p>
        In this experiment I have used the Google maps API for providing the option for autocomplete. I need the user to enter any city he has visited, so I have restricetd the search to cities only.
    </p>
    <li><b>Background Video</b></li>
    <p>
        In this experiment, I have tried playing a video in the background which will be my project home page. CSS does not support videos as background but HTML5 supports that. Here I have deon that through autolooping <strong>video</strong> tag. Also user can pause/unpause the video at his will.
    </p>
    <li><b>Sign Up Modal</b></li>
    <p>
        In this experiment, I have provided an option of registration to the user. Here the info entered by user is passed to Node server as json object and then that object is inserted in the user collection.
    </p>
    <li><b>Travel Destination Search</b></li>
    <p>
        In this experiment, a user can search famous tourist destinations of a particular city. The purpose is to make user select the places he had visited in the city and fill in the details. I have used freebase API for getting tourist attractions of a place.
