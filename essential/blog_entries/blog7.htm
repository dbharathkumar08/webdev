<p>This is my eighth week of web development class and in this week I am doing experiments related to MongoDB</p>
Here is the link to experiments:

<h3>Experiment Description</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Developer Info</b></li>
    <p>
        In this experiment, I have added to last week's experiment of developer data using Node on Openshift. There, I was maintaining the data on server, so everytime the server was restarted, the data used to vanish. Instead here I am using MongoDB to store and fetch the data. I have used the MongoDB and RockMongo on openshift for connecting to the database.
    </p>
    <li><b>User Login</b></li>
    <p>
        In this experiment, I have stored the user credential in <i>UserModel</i> collection in the MongoDB. I have tried connectiong to the database and use that data to login. 
    </p>
    <li><b>Profile Edit</b></li>
    <p>
        In this experiment, I have stored the user credential in <i>UserModel</i> collection in the MongoDB. I have tried connectiong to the database and use that data to login. 
    </p>
    <li><b>Add new user</b></li>
    <p>
        In this experiment, I have provided an option of registration to the user. Here the info entered by user is passed to Node server as json object and then that object is inserted in the user collection.
    </p>
    <li><b>Browse User Profiles</b></li>
    <p>
        In this experiment, after logging in, a user can see other user's profile: their basic information. This will be further enhanced to be used in my project to view other people's profiles, follow them,like and review their portfolios.
    </p>
</ul>
