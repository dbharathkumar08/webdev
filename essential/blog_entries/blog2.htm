<h3>Experiment Description</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Ajax Using jQuery</b></li>
    <p>
        In this experiment I have tried to use AJAX through JQuery. Here I have made a JSONP request to retrieve some information from remote page.Here the .ajax() function calls that page and stores the values in variables to display them on current HTML page.
    </p>
    <li><b>Text Highlighter</b></li>
    <p>
        In this experiment I have tried to make a search box which  highlights the text typed in.
    </p>
     <li><b>Floating Menu</b></li>
        <p>
            In this experiment I have created a menu which floats up and down as we scroll up and down the page
        </p>
    <li><b>Popup</b></li>
    <p>
        In this experiment I have tried creating a popup box by clicking on which the background becomes blur and popup is highlighted
    </p>
    
</ul>
